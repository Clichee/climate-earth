 * Handling everything around the climate (.nc) data.
 * 
 * This file will call the JSON Files, 
 * which were converted to json from NetCDF,
 * and extract their relevant information
 * to project it onto the map.
 * 
 * Not sure how much of that will be in this file for now.
 * Also, files will be called locally for now.
 * Migration to call from an API (and trigger the conversen process)
 * will be done later
